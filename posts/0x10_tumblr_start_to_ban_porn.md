汤不热开始禁止成人内容了！
---
十二月4号，tumblr 的官方账号发布信息，从2018年12月17日开始将开始全面禁止成人内容在。公告一出，网民们纷纷叫好。作为一位国际主义的码农，这个时候当然不能错过去再登录汤站学(kan)英(kan)语(pian)的机会了。一位作为政策性的调整，网站不仅发了英文的版本，还发了中文的版本。作为英语爱好者，当然可以借此来对比两个版本来学习英语咯。

>Since its founding in 2007, Tumblr has always been a place for wide open, creative self-expression at the heart of community and culture. To borrow from our founder David Karp, we’re proud to have inspired a generation of artists, writers, creators, curators, and crusaders to redefine our culture and to help empower individuality.

自 2007 年创立以来，Tumblr 一直是一个以社区和文化为核心的、能够开放地、创造性地自我表达的场所。借用我们的创始人 David Karp 的话来说，我们很自豪有幸激励了一代艺术家、作家、创作者、策展人和奋斗者来重新定义我们的文化，为个性赋予了更多的力量。

>Over the past several months, and inspired by our storied past, we’ve given serious thought to who we want to be to our community moving forward and have been hard at work laying the foundation for a better Tumblr. We’ve realized that in order to continue to fulfill our promise and place in culture, especially as it evolves, we must change. Some of that change began with  [fostering more constructive dialogue among our community members](https://staff.tumblr.com/post/177449083750/new-community-guidelines). Today, we’re taking another step by no longer allowing adult content, including explicit sexual content and nudity (with some exceptions).

在过去的几个月里，受到我们历史的启发，我们认真进行了考量，思考我们在不断发展的社区中希望扮演什么样的角色，并努力为发展一个更好的 Tumblr 打下基础。我们已经意识到，为了继续履行我们的承诺并巩固我们在文化中的地位，特别是当文化不断发展之时，我们必须改变 。其中一些变化始于[促进我们社区成员之间更具建设性的对话](https://guanbo.tumblr.com/post/177491677968/%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E7%9A%84%E7%A4%BE%E5%8C%BA%E5%87%86%E5%88%99%E6%AD%A3%E5%9C%A8%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0-%E4%BF%9D%E9%9A%9C-tumblr)。今天，我们迈出了另一步，不再允许出现成人内容，包括不雅的涉性内容和裸露（有一些例外）。

>Let’s first be unequivocal about something that should not be confused with today’s policy change: posting anything that is harmful to minors, including child pornography, is abhorrent and has no place in our community. We’ve always had and always will have a zero tolerance policy for this type of content. To this end, we continuously invest in the enforcement of this policy, including industry-standard machine monitoring, a growing team of human moderators, and user tools that make it easy to report abuse. We also closely partner with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Internet Watch Foundation, two invaluable organizations at the forefront of protecting our children from abuse, and through these partnerships we report violations of this policy to law enforcement authorities. We can never prevent all bad actors from attempting to abuse our platform, but we make it our highest priority to keep the community as safe as possible.

让我们首先明确一点，不要将它与今天的政策变化混为一谈：发布任何对未成年人有害的内容，包括儿童色情内容，都令人憎恶且不容于我们的社区。对于此类内容，我们一直以来都设立了并始终采取了零容忍政策。为此，我们不断加大投资推动此政策的实施，包括符合行业标准的机器监控、不断壮大的人类仲裁团队以及便于举报滥用行为的用户工具。我们还与国家失踪与受剥削儿童中心和互联网观察基金会密切合作，这两个组织均位于保护我们的儿童免受虐待的最前沿。我们通过这些伙伴关系向执法机关报告违反该政策的行为。我们永远无法阻止所有不良行为者试图滥用我们的平台，但我们将社区安全列为首要任务， 尽我们所能保障社区的安全。

## So what is changing?(那么会有什么改变？)

> Posts that contain adult content will no longer be allowed on Tumblr, and we’ve  [updated our Community Guidelines](https://www.tumblr.com/policy/new_community)  to reflect this policy change. We recognize Tumblr is also a place to speak freely about topics like art, sex positivity, your relationships, your sexuality, and your personal journey. We want to make sure that we continue to foster this type of diversity of expression in the community, so our new policy strives to strike a balance.

Tumblr 将不再允许出现包含成人内容的帖子，我们已更新了[社区准则](https://www.tumblr.com/policy/new_community)以反映这一政策更改。我们认识到， Tumblr 也是一个自由发表任何话题的地方 ，例如艺术、积极的性态度、你的人际关系、性取向和个人历程等。我们希望确保在社区中继续鼓励这种多元化的表达，因此我们的新政策力求取得一种平衡。

## Why are we doing this?

It is our continued, humble aspiration that Tumblr be a safe place for creative expression, self-discovery, and a deep sense of community. As Tumblr continues to grow and evolve, and our understanding of our impact on our world becomes clearer, we have a responsibility to consider that impact across different age groups, demographics, cultures, and mindsets. We spent considerable time weighing the pros and cons of expression in the community that includes adult content. In doing so, it became clear that without this content we have the opportunity to create a place where more people feel comfortable expressing themselves.

Bottom line: There are no shortage of sites on the internet that feature adult content. We will leave it to them and focus our efforts on creating the most welcoming environment possible for our community.

## So what’s next?

Starting December 17, 2018, we will begin enforcing this new policy. Community members with content that is no longer permitted on Tumblr will get a heads up from us in advance and steps they can take to appeal or preserve their content outside the community if they so choose. All changes won’t happen overnight as something of this complexity takes time.

Another thing, filtering this type of content versus say, a political protest with nudity or the statue of David, is not simple at scale. We’re relying on automated tools to identify adult content and humans to help train and keep our systems in check. We know there will be mistakes, but we’ve done our best to create and enforce a policy that acknowledges the breadth of expression we see in the community.

Most importantly, we’re going to be as transparent as possible with you about the decisions we’re making and resources available to you,  [including more detailed information](https://support.tumblr.com/post/180758979032/updates-to-tumblrs-community-guidelines), product enhancements, and more content moderators to interface directly with the community and content.

Like you, we love Tumblr and what it’s come to mean for millions of people around the world. Our actions are out of love and hope for our community. We won’t always get this right, especially in the beginning, but we are determined to make your experience a positive one.
