Hello World. 大家好, 我是 pshu. 今天是码农英语课堂的第12期了.


上一期在讲 OO 发明历史的时候留了一个铺垫, 简单的提了下在 OO 诞生的过程中,一篇论文推向了高潮.那是哪篇论文呢?谁写的呢?

首先这篇文章是 "",(虽然我列了你们也不会去看), 作者是 Tony Hoare. 估计很多人没听过这个名字, 但是只要你是程序员肯定接触过这个大声的发明之一: qsort 快速排序.




>I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language (ALGOL W). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.
