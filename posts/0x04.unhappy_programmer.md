hello world, 我是 pshu , 这里是码农英语课堂的第四期.
今天不说单词了, 问下大家作为你程序员你快乐吗?作为一个程序员,什么事情会让你难受?


# 快乐很重要,可是...
pshu 在 youtube 闲逛的时候看到一篇论文的标题<On the Unhappiness of Software Developers>(程序员的不爽)
大概浏览了下论文感觉还是挺有意思的,就和大家分享论文的摘要和节选.


> The happy-productive worker thesis states that happy workers are more productive. Recent research in software engineering supports the thesis, and the ideal of flourishing happiness among software developers is often expressed among industry practitioners. 

有种说法:快乐的员工工作效率高.最近在软件行业的研究也验证了这种说法; 在软件从业者想在程序员中间营造的开心氛围的想法也经常被看到.

> However, the literature suggests that a cost-effective way to foster happiness and productivity among workers could be to limit unhappiness. Psychological disorders such as job burnout and anxiety could also be reduced by limiting the negative experiences of software developers. 

但是这篇论文表明: 营造开心高效的工作氛围的有效方法还是限制不良情绪的发生; 类似没有工作精力,焦虑等不良心理问题都可以通过减少开发人员的负面体验来降低发生.

* cost-effective 有效的
* foster 培养,促进



Simultaneously, a baseline assessment of (un)happiness and knowledge about how developers experience it are missing. 


In this paper, we broaden the understanding of unhappiness among software developers in terms of 

(1) the software developer population distribution of (un)happiness, and 
(2) the causes of unhappiness while developing software. 

> We conducted a large-scale quantitative and qualitative survey, incorporating a psychometrically validated instrument for measuring (un)happiness, with 2220 developers, yielding a rich and balanced sample of 1318 complete responses. 

在对2220为开发者进行了进行了大规模的定性和定量的调查,包括采用一些心理学上的设备来测定开发者的不良情绪,最终产生了

> Our results indicate that software developers are a slightly happy population,
but the need for limiting the unhappiness of developers remains. 

我们的研究结果表明,软件开发人员还是一个比较快乐的群体,但是对限制不利情绪的需要仍然存在.


> We also identified 219 factors representing causes of unhappiness while developing software. 

我们还发现发现了219个在软件开发中对程序员造成不良情绪的因素.

Our results, which are available as open data, can act as guidelines for practitioners in management positions and developers in general for fostering happiness on the job. We suggest considering happiness in future studies of both human and technical aspects in software engineering. 

> 所有的研究结果将作为开放数据提供给大众, 可以作为管理人员在培养工作中的幸福感的指南.
